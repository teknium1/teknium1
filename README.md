# Hello, I'm [Teknium1](https://github.com/teknium1) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python Programmer, AI Enthusiast, and Co-founder of [NousResearch](https://nousresearch.com/). 

My work primarily involves AI and Data Engineering, contributing primarily by releasing open source Large Language Model (LLMs) and datasets.

## ðŸš€ My Work 

### ðŸ’¼ Nous Research 

I've contributed significantly to the development of several opensource LLMs under [Nous Research's huggingface organization](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch). 

Here are a couple of them: 

- [Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b) - A Hermes model built on llama 1 and llama 2, which I'm well known for.
- [GPT4-x-Vicuna-13b](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/gpt4-x-vicuna-13b) - A Vicuna model built on GPT-4.

### ðŸš€ Personal Projects 

On my personal huggingface, [Teknium](https://huggingface.co/teknium), I have released several models:

- [Replit-Instruct 3B](https://huggingface.co/teknium/Replit-v1-CodeInstruct-3B) - This model doubled the code performance of the LLM.

### ðŸ’» Github Projects 

I've been part of several intriguing projects on GitHub. Here are a few of them:

- [GPTeacher](https://github.com/teknium1/GPTeacher-Public) - A collection of modular datasets generated by GPT-4, for training LLMs.
- [RawTransform](https://github.com/teknium1/RawTransform) - A repository of prompts and Python scripts for intelligent transformation of raw text into diverse formats.
- [stanford_alpaca-replit](https://github.com/teknium1/stanford_alpaca-replit) - Modified Stanford-Alpaca Trainer for Training Replit's Code Model.
- [alpaca-discord](https://github.com/teknium1/alpaca-discord) - A Simple Discord Bot for the Alpaca LLM.
- [alpaca-roleplay-discordbot](https://github.com/teknium1/alpaca-roleplay-discordbot) - An LLM discord bot that roleplays!
